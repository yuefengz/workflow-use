‚öôÔ∏è **Workflow Use** is the easiest way to create and execute deterministic workflows with variables which fallback to [Browser Use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) if a step fails. You just _show_ the recorder the workflow, we automatically generate the workflow.

‚ùó This project is in very early development so we don't recommend using this in production. Lots of things will change and we don't have a release schedule yet. Originally, the project was born out of customer demand to make Browser Use more reliable and deterministic.

# Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/browser-use/workflow-use
```

## Build the extension

```bash
cd extension && npm install && npm run build
```

## Setup workflow environment

```bash
cd .. && cd workflows
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate # for mac / linux
playwright install chromium
cp .env.example .env # add your OPENAI_API_KEY to the .env file
```


## Run workflow as tool

```bash
python cli.py run-as-tool examples/example.workflow.json --prompt "fill the form with example data"
```

## Run workflow with predefined variables

```bash
python cli.py run-workflow examples/example.workflow.json 
```

## Record your own workflow

```bash
python cli.py create-workflow
```

## See all commands

```bash
python cli.py --help
```

# Usage from python

Running the workflow files is as simple as:

```python
from workflow_use import Workflow

workflow = Workflow.load_from_file("example.workflow.json")
result = asyncio.run(workflow.run_as_tool("I want to search for 'workflow use'"))
```

## Launch the GUI

The Workflow UI provides a visual interface for managing, viewing, and executing workflows.

### Option 1: Using the CLI command (Recommended)

The easiest way to start the GUI is with the built-in CLI command:

```bash
cd workflows
python cli.py launch-gui
```

This command will:
- Start the backend server (FastAPI)
- Start the frontend development server
- Automatically open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
- Capture logs to the `./tmp/logs` directory

Press Ctrl+C to stop both servers when you're done.

### Option 2: Start servers separately

Alternatively, you can start the servers individually:

#### Start the backend server

```bash
cd workflows
uvicorn backend.api:app --reload
```

#### Start the frontend development server

```bash
cd ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

Once both servers are running, you can access the Workflow GUI at http://localhost:5173 in your browser. The UI allows you to:

- Visualize workflows as interactive graphs
- Execute workflows with custom input parameters
- Monitor workflow execution logs in real-time
- Edit workflow metadata and details

# Features

- üîÅ **Record Once, Reuse Forever**: Record browser interactions once and replay them indefinitely.
- ‚è≥ **Show, don't prompt**: No need to spend hours prompting Browser Use to do the same thing over and over again.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Structured & Executable Workflows**: Converts recordings into deterministic, fast, and reliable workflows which automatically extract variables from forms.
- ü™Ñ **Human-like Interaction Understanding**: Intelligently filters noise from recordings to create meaningful workflows.
- üîí **Enterprise-Ready Foundation**: Built for future scalability with features like self-healing and workflow diffs.

# Vision and roadmap

Show computer what it needs to do once, and it will do it over and over again without any human intervention.

## Workflows

- [ ] Nice way to use the `.json` files inside python code
- [ ] Improve LLM fallback when step fails (currently really bad)
- [ ] Self healing, if it fails automatically agent kicks in and updates the workflow file
- [ ] Better support for LLM steps
- [ ] Take output from previous steps and use it as input for next steps
- [ ] Expose workflows as MCP tools
- [ ] Use Browser Use to automatically create workflows from websites

## Developer experience

- [ ] Improve CLI
- [ ] Improve extension
- [ ] Step editor

## Agent

- [ ] Allow Browser Use to use the workflows as MCP tools
- [ ] Use workflows as website caching layer
